## 3D Printed CNC Router

**Background:** Following the completion of my 3D printer, I now wanted a hobby sized CNC to complement it. The open source design of the 'MPCNC' from [V1Engineering](https://www.v1engineering.com/) was a suitable candidate, and allowed me to test the capabilities of my 3D printer. Being a mix of PLA plastic and mild steel tubing it is far from rigid, but is able to mill through wood, plastics, and aluminum with success. This machine proved to be a great platform for learning basic CAM and machining theory.

### Printing the Parts

The 3D printed parts total to ~2.2 kg of plastic filament and took ~120 hours. Printing overnight and daily reduced the total printing time to just over a week, but was overall successful with no failed prints. Some parts are seen in the pictures below:

The large part seen in this photo took ~20 hours to print and weighs over 1 lb

### Assembly



### 3. Manufacturing

While most 3D printers both commercial and consumer level utilize aluminum extrusions for their frames, I was unable to find a reasonable quote for the necessary aluminum extrusion I needed. I had coincidentally been teaching myself to TIG weld at the time, and decided a steel frame for the printer would be a suitable first project. Despite low quality welds, adequate weld penetration was acheived in most joints, yielding a very strong and rigid frame; a bit overkill for this project.

Linear rail mounts for the Y-axis were created from scrap 6MM aluminum plate from a school project, they were cut using a jigsaw and sanded to dimension.
