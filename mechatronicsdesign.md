## Mechatronics Design Project - Autonomous Robot

**Background:** Tasked with designing, building, and programming a robot which could traverse a maze with no prior instruction or mapping, this robot was designed and built. Unfortunately, due to sudden COVID-19 closures, the project was unfinished as we were beginning programming and sensor installation/configuration. The design uses 4 dc motors, each with a rotary encoder feedback, operating in closed-loop. Speed control was performed by two L293 H-bridge ICs and an Arduino MEGA.

### Fabrication

The design uses all aluminum parts, with basic 1/8" plate for the top and bottom, round stock drilled and tapped for each supporting pillar, and wheel adaptors to mount the incompatible wheels to the keyed shaft of the motors.

This cross section view of the designed wheel adaptors show how they mount on the keyed shaft using a set screw. These were turned from round stock on a manual lathe.

### Finished Design

Although this project could not be completed, it was a good learning experience going through the steps to design a potentially working prototype, both in hardware and software.
