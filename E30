## 1990 BMW E30

**Background:** For a number of years, I had wanted an E30 BMW (3-Series). This is an archive of the progress 

### Printing the Parts

The 3D printed parts total to ~2.2 kg of plastic filament and took ~120 hours. Printing overnight and daily reduced the total printing time to just over a week, but was overall successful with no failed prints. Some parts are seen in the pictures below:

The large part seen in this photo took ~20 hours to print and weighs over 1 lb

### Assembly

Assembly of the CNC was straightforward, mostly comprising of fastening printed parts to steel tubing, squaring the rails, and installing electronics/wiring.
The Z-Axis of the CNC to which the router is mounted is seen in this photo:
