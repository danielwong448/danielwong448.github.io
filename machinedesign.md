## Machine Design Project - Box Lifting Machine

**Background:** This was a fairly simple machine design project. It utilized a pulley system with a cascading sliding frame to lift boxes well above it's own height. Due to cost constraints and limited resources, it has a lackluster appearence utilizing construction lumber and ball bearing drawer slides for linear motion. A welded steel frame and some basic machined parts were fabricated by myself for this design as well.

### Electronics

Three DC motors (open loop) were each driven by an electronic speed controller, each for a specific degree of freedom. A pulse width modulation signal was sent by an Arduino and was used to set the speed, as well as ramp speed in controlling the motion of the machine.

### Working Prototype

The machine performed as expected, and was capable of lifting upwards of 50lbs, above the height of the machine in it's closed position. The design leaves much room for improvement, but was a fun experience overall.
